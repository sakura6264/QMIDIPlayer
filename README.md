# QMIdIPlayer
## A Simple Midi Player
The GUI is made with [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/), and it uses [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) to render the animation.  
It depends on library [QMidi](https://github.com/waddlesplash/QMidi) to play midi file.  
To compile this project, you should make sure that you have already install Qt5.  
Then you can easily execute the "deploy.ps1"(or "deploy.sh"). Soon, you'll found 
the program under the directory "deploy".
